### Customer Journey Analysis
📌 Overview

This project analyzes the customer journey across channels to derive actionable insights for marketing, retention, and growth strategies. It uses real customer, touchpoint, and purchase data to perform cohort, lifetime value (CLV), attribution, and channel ROI analyses.

### 🚀 Key Features & Analyses

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data validation of customer, touchpoint, and purchase records.

Attribution modeling to assess effectiveness of marketing channels in the customer journey.

Customer Lifetime Value and cohort analysis to understand retention and customer behavior over time.

SQL-based analytics and dashboards to support business decision-making.

### 
🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
Component	Tools / Languages
Data Processing & Notebooks	Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks
Data Storage / Data Schema	CSV datasets, Data Dictionary
Querying & Analytics	SQL (custom queries for CLV, attribution, cohort)
Visualization	Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotting tools, output dashboards and chart images
Version Control	Git / GitHub


### ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu8560/Customer-Journey-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Journey-Analysis
```

2.**Install dependencies (if using virtual environment)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. **Explore the data**

- Open notebooks in notebooks/ to follow along analyses: EDA → Attribution → CLV → Cohort.

- Run SQL queries
- Load CSVs into a SQL engine (SQLite / any RDBMS) or use tools like DuckDB, then run queries under sql_queries/.

4. **View Visualizations**
- Visual outputs located in visualizations/ for channel ROI, cohort trends, value over time etc.

### 📈 Outcomes & Insights

- Identified top-performing marketing channels with high ROI.

- Found customer cohorts with >20% retention after 6 months.

- Discovered & presented cross-channel overlap and attribution bias, helping optimize ad spend.
